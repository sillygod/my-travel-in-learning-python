# Environment

### under elementary os

`python2.7.8`

`pygame1.9.1`


# Intention:

Just give a try to write a simple physics simulation about collision and what's more, I will implement one pure python version vector and the other
c++ version vector.

To compare the performance, create a simple collision environment


# How to compile vector shared library

```sh
cd vector_lib
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

this will produce the shared library under current directory.
