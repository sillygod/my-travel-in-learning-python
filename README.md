============================

> In order to learning python, I think some project to implement and try hard to complete them.
  bascially, there is some library I want to be familiar with

```
 1. pygame
 2. pyqt

```

> Recently, I try to make a simple gui for pygame(lacks of the gui).
  although people always say that don't remake the wheel, I think
  sometimes you can get some good idea from remaking those wheels.

  now, I am in soldier service so I don't have much time to write program, sigh...
