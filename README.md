# my-travel-in-learning-python


In order to learning python, I think some project to implement and try hard to complete them. Bascially, there is some library I want to be familiar with

 - pygame
 - pyqt
 - django



# projecct-list

- 2d collision
- chase_or_chat
- cli_chatroom
- imageCropper
- imageDisplayer


### 2d collision

**DESC:**

implement 2d vector by pure python and by c++. Try to compare the efficiency between the vector implement by python and implement by c++


### chase_or_chat

**DESC**

now, everything is just a practice due to lots of thing needed to learn ex. the game design in javascrtip,
 how to interacitve the front end with the django's backend. In the future, I will make a small project


### cli_chatroom

**DESC**

use windows api `socket` to implement a chatroom based on console interface.



### imageCropper

**DESC**

an imageCropper which you can crop an image like the avatar creater.


### imageDisplayer

to support show animated gif image, the function which native windows image display lacks.
it has some extra function like get image from url and clipboard.



now, I am in soldier service so I don't have much time to write program, sigh...
