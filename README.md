# my-travel-in-learning-python


This repository may contain some projects or practices I want to make a note. It is just like a traveler to take a snap shot of everything everywhere. Python is my favorite programming language and it has lots of amazing merits and something shock.


### Intention

In order to learning python, I think some projects to implement and try hard to complete them. Bascially, there are some librarys or frameworks I want to be familiar with

 - pygame
 - pyqt
 - django
 - ...


# projecct-list

 - 2d collision
 - django_zoo
 - cli_chatroom
 - imageCropper
 - imageDisplayer
 - ...maybe more


# structure

Once I complete some projects, I will make every project structured like..

ex.

```
proj/
    some src files or folder..
    requirement.txt
    readme.md

```

everything you need just `pip install` or `docker-compose` if provided `docker-compose.yml`
