### what is my-travel-in-learngin-python

This repository may contain some projects or practices I want to make a note. It is just like a traveler to take a snap shot of everything everywhere. Python is my favorite programming language and it has lots of amazing merits and something shock.


### Intention

In order to learning python, I think some projects to implement and try hard to complete them. Bascially, there are some librarys or frameworks I want to be familiar with

 - pygame
 - pyqt
 - django
 - ...


# projecct-list

 - 2d collision
 - chase_or_chat
 - cli_chatroom
 - imageCropper
 - imageDisplayer
 - ...maybe more


# structure

Once I complete some projects, I will make every project structured like..

ex.

```
proj/
    some src files or folder..
    requirement.txt
    readme.md

```

everything you need just `pip install`


### 2d collision

implement 2d vector by pure python and by c++. Try to compare the efficiency between the vector implement by python and implement by c++


### chase_or_chat

now, everything is just a practice due to lots of thing needed to learn

ex. the game design in javascrtip, how to interacitve the front end with the django's backend. In the future, I will make a small project


### cli_chatroom

use windows api `socket` to implement a chatroom based on console interface.



### imageCropper

an imageCropper which you can crop an image like the avatar creater.


### imageDisplayer

to support show animated gif image, the function which native windows image display lacks.
it has some extra function like get image from url and clipboard.
